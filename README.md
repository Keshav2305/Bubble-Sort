# Bubble-Sort
A Cpp code showing a sorting method known as bubble sort
## Theory
Bubble Sort Algorithm is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
### How it works
It compares the adjecent pairs and swaps the two if they are in the wrong order. After the First Iteration, the last value is guarenteed to be the right place so the next iteration goes till N-1<sup>th</sup> place.
Therefore the loop take (N(N-1))/2 comparisons to complete its sorting. (N=number of elements).
